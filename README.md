# Neural Data Pipeline for Kilosort
This project was commissioned to create an accessible pipeline for optimizing sorting of dense and large-scale neural data. It is built around a pre-existing library called Kilosort which uses machine learning techniques such as clustering and template matching to sort neurons across time even if they are located extremely close to one another. This pipeline took the already existing library and created a pre and post processing portion to minimize manual work to nearly zero.
